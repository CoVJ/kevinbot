README - kevinbot v0.9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an open beta of kevinbot, an bot for moderating the game of "Mafia" or
"Werewolves" over IRC. It has not been thoroughly tested. It does not support
TLS/SSL (for a workaround, consider stunnel). It also does not adhere to sound
principles of Python programming or object-oriented design. Furthermore, it
probably does not work on Python 3. These things are left for v1.0 :)

Right now the main bot does not provide any API for adding custom roles. This
is planned for v2.0.

kevinbot uses the MIT-licensed oyoyo IRC library. A copy of this library is
included with kevinbot.

For help, see github.com/t3nsor/kevinbot/wiki

Enjoy!
